            <p>I've had the opportunity to partake in many different work placements during college while studying the T-level in Digital production, Design and Development such as joining a placement based on animation, graphic design and art and another that allowed me to expand my skills in coding, web development and collaborating with other coders but am also excited to continue exploring new challenges and opportunities.</p>
            
            <p>When it comes to job experience, I have worked in a few different places such as my first job at tangs packaging orders and taking orders. This was able to help me expand on my communication and practical skills as I got to speak to many customers and work with other colleagues. Not long after my time working at Tangs, I was given the opportunity to do work placement at Yandiya Technologies. I was able to work with other students and members of the company to create a digital transformation through storing documents from paper to computer. While this expanded my technical skills, I felt that I was also able to work well with many different people when it came to collaborative work, while also working independently on other jobs such as creating a functioning website for the company which they approved of using.</p>
        
            <p>I'm a massive cat lover. Cats are amazing for many reasons. Firstly, they are incredibly independent creatures who can take care of themselves to a great extent. They are also very clean animals and spend a lot of time grooming themselves. Additionally, cats are great companions and can bring a lot of joy and comfort to their owners. They are also very intelligent animals and are known to be able to problem solve and learn new things. Lastly, cats are simply adorable and their cute and quirky personalities make them great pets for anyone.</p>
